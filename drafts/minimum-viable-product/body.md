Not all at once
---

It isn't possible to accomplish everything all at the same time. It never has been and it never will be. A lot of projects have a lot of steps. Even more so a lot of projects have steps that didn't even exist at the beginning. There will always be more. You can never find perfect. The only guarantee is that things will change and that is true for any content you make. So why try to tackle everything at once? Why try to expect that everything you want to do needs to be done all at once? One of the best piece of advices I can give is stop trying to conquer the world and instead focus on conquering your home (perhaps there is a sibling involved). Then move on to your school and eventually your town. Start small move out. That's how we begin.

Key Goal
---

When creating content you always have goals for the project. There is always something that NEEDS to be conveyed. Something matters to you and that is the reason that you are even contemplating starting a project. The question is how many goals do you have and what is the best first goal to start with. Write an entire list and figure out what the most important thing for this project is. Is it to share a very particular style of gameplay? Is it to show off a particular mechanic? Is it to make people believe they are actually in the world? Or is it to convince them that a war happened between two people? Doesn't matter, pick what matters to you most. Use that as a guideline.

Design the Minimum
---

There is a minimum amount of work you have to do to communicate your key goal. If you are trying to communicate a game mechanic, then does it really matter if your characters are hand drawn or done in comic book style? Nope... what matters is that you actually communicate the mechanic. Are you trying to communicate a war zone? Find the elements that truly communicate that the area is a war zone. Perhaps dead bodies, left over weapons, gore, and fire. Figure out the absolute minimum you need to communicate your key goal. You should pick the ABSOLUTE minimum, go to each thing and ask, can you convey a war zone without this? And don't be flexible, be strict.

Complete it
---

Got your minimums? Now do it <<<Reference the Nike Philosophy article>>>. Seriously do the minimum and don't get sucked into anything else. Don't color pretty pictures if your goal is to make fun gameplay. Don't waste your time on making line of sights work out if you are trying to make something absolutely gorgeous. It isn't worth your time to focus on anything else. Build the minimum and get it out there now. Not only does it get you a starting place, but it shows people that that idea is yours. And the sooner you have the MVP done the sooner you get feedback. Also it is MUCH easier to change things rather than build from scratch. So do yourself a favor and finish an MVP so you have a starting point. We've already learned that you don't need it to be pretty. Just do it.
