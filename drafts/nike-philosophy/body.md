Productivity is Hard
---

Raise your hand if you have ever felt stuck on a project. Perhaps a little dose of designer's or developer's block. It isn't easy to do something other than thinking. Thinking is easy. Talking is easy too. There have been many times where I have walked around on a map instead of actually making the changes I need to. Sometimes I stress over whether or not what I make will actually come out well. Or perhaps the complexity scares me and the problem solving. Nothing is more difficult than actually doing. Seriously... I think the biggest thing that stops people is just starting. When most of us get going, we fly forward. It is just a matter of starting.

Enter Nike

So despite being corny, one of the things that I have learned over the years is to suck it up and "just do it". Seriously, that is all it takes. The best piece of advice I can give to you is to just start doing something. If you are building a map make a floor. If you are creating a gametype start writing out your inspirations. If you are writing an article just start writing the first thing that comes to mind. That's how I'm getting through these articles. Just go. Just do it. This particular phrase REALLY sits with me. There was a point in my life where I was job hunting and it felt ridiculously difficult to work on my resume and even more so just looking for jobs. At the time Shia LeBouf's artistic video of him screaming "just do it" had come out and that little skit really sat with me. So I let it play in the background very quietly in the background of my usual playlist. It subconsciously programmed my brain to yell at myself to "just do it". Funny ending to that story, a few weeks later I got a call from a recruiter saying that he had a position for me at Nike as a Software Engineer. Crazy coincidence, but I did get the job and it was an awesome experience. Needless to say, I just did it. ;)

Don't let Sloppiness Stop You
---

One of the major things that keep individuals from actually doing something is their worry of not actually doing a project well. Let me be the first to tell you or remind you that typically the first iteration of the things you build will not be good. Hands down. When that sits down with you it is a lot easier to just start going. The good news is that nothing is truly permanent. Even better something that you have in development is especially not permanent because you have fully control over it yourself and it hasn't reached external hands. If you write software and use Git you even have the ability to run amends, rebases, and fixups. Seriously just start. Nobody cares about what your first variant is. What people care about is the version that they actually use, now if that doesn't work the right way then you have some risks. But right now? At the idea and prototype stage, you are perfectly fine. Just kill it.

Build the habit now
---

If you are worried about doing this with a particular project, then go start a different one. The point of the matter is that this is a skill that can be built and gets easier as you do it. I had no idea what I was going to write for this article with no particular organization. It used to keep me from actually putting out content. Eventually I realized that things like editting actually exists. One of the best things to do is to spit out as much as you physically can and then go over it and remove stuff. The most polished projects are things that typically started massive and then were reduced to a feasible state and refined on the way down. Take the time to build the habit and you won't regret that ability. Apply to everything you do. Don't put it off. I use to put off the ability to automate something because I was always worried about not actually getting to the thing that I needed to do. Eventually I started focusing on automation and now I have all this knowledge and automating or making my life easier in general is a much easier task because now I know more than I did. Doing gets you experience and that is more valuable than you could bossibly realize.
