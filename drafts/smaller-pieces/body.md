Too much at once
---

The most dangerous thing I've seen people do is force themselves to sit through a massively long session to try to get work done. This doesn't actually allow you to get more work done. You'll notice that instead of progressing, eventually you feel stuck. Or you start to get sluggish. Or eventually you get hungry or thirsty. Piling on a MASSIVE amount of work doesn't actually accomplish anything. It took me a long time to learn this. I used to think I need to push through and get things done. Yeah definitely don't do this. It is the least productive way of working.

Smaller is Better
---

So typically you get a lunch break int he middle of the day and that is nice and gets you a nice little refresh, but something else about long days is that they are prone to making you not productive after lunch. You look at work as a MASSIVE ordeal and you feel like you can't really start because you don't have the energy too now that you are bloated from a very comforting lunch. Large amounts of work are daunting. So make them smaller. I look at a big project and I cry. Nowadays I look at each of the individual steps that the project takes and I tackle each little step one at a time. So now after lunch I sit down and I'm like... you know what I can handle adding a couple of comments to this file. And as soon as I add comments to the file, I give myself a little mental break and mental acknowledgement reward. Then I look at the next file and I say you know what I can totally get those comments done too. Next think you know I've now commented the entire project.
