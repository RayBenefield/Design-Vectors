Halo Forge PC is out and about now and the Halo Forge community is growing fast. For those who are new to the scene I'd like to welcome you. For those who are still moving along in the Forge community, keep doing what you're doing. From inexperienced to old timers, you play a critical in the growth of this community. I've been around since the dawn of Forge back in Halo 3 in 2007... and I'm still here. This tool has given me the passion I needed to finally take the dive into game design that I've always wanted to take. I've learned a lot over the years from experimentation, colleagues, actual content, and the vast amount of resources on the internet. And this is my way of trying to spread that knowledge even more into a community that is still honestly in its infancy. We are way behind developers in other games. So perhaps this will help us stir the pot a bit.
