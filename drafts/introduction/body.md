A bit about myself
---

In 2009, I decided to try to package my own philosophies on game/level design into tiny consumable packages in the form of Forge Lessons. The series' namesake, Halo Forge, was the new in-game level editor for Halo and was also my first real dive into game/level design. Needless to say I've learned a lot in that time. So prior to the Halo: Reach Forge iteration I started writing that from what I had learned from being a major part of Halo Forge sites, like Forgehub, and having gotten many pieces of content featured and 1 in Halo 3's matchmaking system. While writing those lessons over the next year, I went on to create 3 additional maps that went into Halo: Reach's matchmaking system.

Fast forward to the time of writing this, I have been a chosen volunteer Community Content Curator with 343 Industries (aka Community Cartographer, we assist in putting community maps in matchmaking) and now I run my own volunteer based content creation team called Creative Force with 15+ amazing individuals (going on a year now). In the "real" world I'm a Lead Software Engineer and Architect. In the time since I wrote those lessons I have changed, experienced, and learned a lot. And I've never stopped wanting to share my own philosophies, so enter the Design Vector Series.


What are Design Vectors
---

Design Vectors is another attempt at sharing my own game/level design philosophies with a hope of expanding the amount of awareness to this still young game development community around Halo. This times itself well with the release of Halo Forge PC, giving the world the ability to experience Forge for free as a game development tool. More on this later. But this isn't just for the Halo community. These Design Vectors will be written in a way that is consumable by as many game design enthusiasts as possible. I look to structure every Design Vector in a form that will try to make it timeless and all inclusive, no matter the development tool you use.

So why "Design Vectors"? One of the core definitions of a "Vector" is a "geometric entity endowed with magnitude and direction". Every lesson will be designed to be bite sized in nature, the vector's magnitude if you will. Every lesson will also seek to push you towards a direction of exploration. Design as a whole in any industry has so many facets to it and so many variables. The goal of the series is to stir up conversation and bring awareness to my own personal opinion on what variables exist for game development. No matter who reads it, this is also a journey to document and explore things for myself and I'd like to just invite you to join me if you are so inclined.


Structure of a Design Vector
---

I'm going to take from my own experience to create a vary specific structure for the Design Vectors. Every Vector will consist of three major parts and cover a single topic to introduce.

---

 - Context

The time of writing every Vector will be different. Sometimes the audience will be different too. The context is the initial "let's touch base real quick". In all forms of the Design Vectors you may not see the context (like in a published PDF).

 - Body

This is the Design Vector, the introduction or brief exploration of a topic. The core of each article, the part of it that will be compiled together if it were to be in a book all together.

 - Challenge

The exploration of the article. This section, like the context will not be in every version of the Design Vectors. It could be only be on relevant sites and won't come out in fully compiled PDFs of the series. The challenge at the end of each Design Vector will give something actionable that will explore, practice, or give exposure to a topic already introduced (like its respective topic) or it will preview and setup for the next topic. Expect this to be a little more revolving around the Halo Forge engine, but not exclusively you may be challenged to try some tools here or there.

---

So three major parts. Each of these lessons will be bite sized... like nowhere near this long. If you have taken a look at the Forge Lessons imagine about that long. About 3-5 paragraphs of the actual Vector, 1 context paragraph, and maybe 1 or 2 challenge paragraphs. Also expect to find resources and media relating to the topic at hand. Something I didn't really do with the Forge Lessons.


Why Halo Forge?
---

There are a couple of things that make Halo Forge more powerful for me than any other tool like Unreal, Unity, Source, etc. Halo Forge was always built with the intention of letting people play with modifying game content. It was initially a way to tweak weapons, spawns, vehicles, and add a couple props here and there. That was a gateway drug for many of us into a wonderful world of design and I think Forge still has that beauty and simplicity. If you find regular game development too daunting this may be your cup of tea.

But Forge also had a powerful component that made it more than your typical PC development tool. Up to 8 players could (and still can) Forge on a single piece of content at a time. What this provides developers is a collaborative environment like I've never seen before. Being able to play a 4v4 with 7 other friends, then after several games jump directly into the tool and have people critique the map was INVALUABLE. There have been many cases where someone said "this hallway is way too long", and someone threw down a quick idea, which someone else built off of, and then someone else. The ideation, brainstorming, and collaboration was such a huge deal. It lead to extremely fast feedback loops.

Speaking of feedback something else that is available, I feel more than most other games, is how easy it is to get regular Halo players (non-developers) to test your content. It didn't take someone to download the map to play it, it didn't take someone to find a server that hosted it, and it didn't take loads of time to put it out there. Just load up a custom game and invite tons of your non-developer Halo friends and press play. The ability to get feedback from non-developers always keep me refining and coming back for more. That is such a powerful tool for growing and learning as a new game developer. And now the tools are more powerful, free, and on the PC. You couldn't ask for a better deal at this time. Not only that the ENTIRE PC community plays nothing but custom games. So if you have friends there, they are guaranteed to not be playing campaign, warzone, firefight, or matchmaking. They are either Forging or playing in customs.

Halo's developers, both Bungie and 343, are also very connected to the community. I've been out to 343 Industries myself as a community member. They truly care about working with community content and in my opinion it is pretty much guaranteed that you are within 2 maybe 3 Bacon numbers away from contact to 343 Industries. That is HUGE. And both Bungie and 343 are all about adding content created by the community into their official matchmaking system. Having experienced that, is amazing and (from my assumptions) as time goes on the path to matchmaking will get easier and easier. So if you aren't already a Halo community developer... come join us and have some fun. We do crazy things like make Jenga, Beer Pong, and Cooking an experience in the Halo engine.
