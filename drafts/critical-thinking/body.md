Debunking Common Sense
---

Nothing ever started out as "common sense". Common sense had to be defined as time went on. Even as "common" sense grows, it is still subjective and contextual. A majority of individuals will blindly follow common sense, but individuals that don't become the disrupters of their time. I'm sure at some point it was common sense to not restrict your users from making massive posts on a social network. My assumption is that <<<The guy that made Twitter>>> made Twitter a success only because he second guessed this common train of thought and asked himself what could happen if individuals were restricted to only 140 characters. I'm sure a good majority of people would have looked at him like he was crazy.

Defy the Majority and Habit
---

If you ever find yourself thinking, "why is this person taking the time to write out common sense", then take a moment and reconsider what you are telling yourself. Don't ever let someone put you down for not having "common sense". Don't ever let comments like "but this is common sense", keep you from exploring further. Human nature survives off of the primitive solution of patterns. Recognizing patterns kept us alive. And as a species we had to learn some patterns extremely quickly. If we didn't, we would end up victims to things like bears and bees. As powerful and important as patterns are in our life, there's something to be said about understanding why those patterns exist in the first place.

Critical Thinking

Enter critical thinking. Can you tell me why a typical first person shooter map benefits from a majority of locations having a minimum of 3 paths? Are you able to ask yourself what happens when you change that number of paths to 15? Or perhaps 1? Critical thinking is all about taking the time to explore why. Follow that up with some "what ifs" and you have a recipe for experimentation and science. And science leads to discoveries, with discoveries leading to true disruption. Very few companies are successful through the act of mostly copying and pasting. Most people aren't content with more of the same with just a different logo.
