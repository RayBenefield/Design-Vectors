Debunking Common Sense
---

Nothing started out as "common sense". Common sense had to be defined as time went on. Even as "common" sense grows, it is still subjective and contextual. A majority blindly follow common sense, but individuals that don't become the disrupters of their time. At some point, it was common sense to not restrict users from making several paragraph long posts on social networks. My assumption is that <<<The guy that made Twitter>>> made Twitter a success through second guessing the common train of thought and asking himself what could happen if individuals were restricted to only 140 characters. I don't doubt a good number of people doubted him for his questioning of "common" sense. There's no need to explain the success that Twitter has had despite heavily restricting users to a mere 140 characters. Seriously, how many characters are in this paragraph?

Defy the Majority and Habit
---

If you find yourself thinking, "why is this person taking the time to write this out, it's common sense", take a moment and reconsider what you tell yourself. Challenging common sense with curiousity is the first step to being innovative and unique. Don't let someone put you down for not having "common sense". Don't let comments like "but that's common sense", keep you from exploring further. Granted, human nature survives off of primitive solutions like patterns. Recognizing patterns keeps us alive. As a species we had to learn some patterns extremely quickly. If we didn't, we ended up victims to regular occurences in nature like bears, bees, and even bad water. As powerful and important as patterns are in our life, there's something to be said about not only breaking those patterns, but also understanding why those patterns exist in the first place.

Critical Thinking

Enter critical thinking. Can you tell me why a typical first person shooter map benefits from a majority of locations having a minimum of 3 paths? Are you able to ask yourself what happens when you change that number of paths to 15? Or 1? Critical thinking is all about taking the time to explore why (and why not) and not letting it pass you by as common knowledge. Follow that up with "what ifs" and you have a recipe for experimentation and science. Which further leads to discoveries, and eventually lead to true disruption of an industry. Very few companies are successful through the act of mostly copying and pasting. Most people aren't content with more of the same with just a different coat of paint. Remember when Pokemon Go hit the scene? That is disruption in an industry. Who knew how far people would walk to make sure they hatch their next egg or hunt down that next Eevee?

Requires Breaking Intuition
---

Moving forward, we can apply this to every single Design Vector that will be written. Many out there will read a vector (or just read the title) and feel like it is not worth their time reading. Has it become common sense for you to test with fresh players without telling them any information? Doesn't that feel like an intuitive sense that everyone should have? That basic intuition is broken with Critical Thinking. Be willing to build up a new base set of knowledge. Be willing to explore the "basics" deeper rather than letting them pass by. Put your critical thinking to the test and question every piece of advice that you come by. Why does it sound like this person has a different point of view? What kind of experiences has this person been through that has drawn them to a different conclusion than your own? Those types of questions are what help us evolve our design sense and evolve as a species.
